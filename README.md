# useCachingFetch Hook

- A custom React hook for client-side data fetching with a shared in-memory cache.
- It avoids duplicate requests by caching data per URL, tracks in-flight requests to prevent redundant fetches, and provides data, isLoading, and error states.
- Fetch is only triggered if no cached data is present or a request isn't already in progress.

# preloadCachingFetch(url: string): Promise<void>

- Preloads and caches data from the provided url for use in SSR (server-side rendering).
- If data is already cached, it does nothing.
- Stores the response in the same shared cache used by useCachingFetch.
- Prevents duplicate fetches and ensures immediate data availability on the client.

# serializeCache(): string

- Called during SSR to transfer server-side cache state to the client
- Serializes the in-memory cache to a JSON string that can be injected into the server-rendered HTML.
- Converts Error objects to strings (error.message)

# initializeCache(serializedCache: string): void

- Rehydrates the shared in-memory cache on the client using the string generated by serializeCache.
- Parses the injected cache JSON
- Reconstructs Error objects
- Ensures client-side useCachingFetch has access to preloaded data

# NEXT STEPS

- Add a timestamp to each cache entry and expire entries after a set time
- Persist the cache in the local storage
